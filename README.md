# NeuralNetworkLite
Kotlin version of a Neural Network. This is a very basic network, nothing fancy.

Look at the Main.kt file to see how to use and setup.

NOTE: This was an attempt at trying to figure out how to code a Neural Network.
This was heavily influenced by other code and articles I read. If there are any discrepancies, please let me know.
I really want to get this right.
